## How can I help?

We are a small team based in New York. We have coded most of Truegit at Kinship Coffee in Astoria close to the Astoria park.

The best way to help us improve Truegit is to use it! Our goal is to make Truegit a tool that gets out of your way when it comes to publishing. Twist it, turn it, break it! We would love to improve it so it becomes more resilient and easy to use.

If you'd like to work with us, please send us an email at hello@truegit.io.
