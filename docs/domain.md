# Domain

By default, we assign a random domain to your blog. If you want to change the domain, you can do using from your dashboard. Note that you must login with the same Github account that you used to install the Github App to access the dashboard of your blogs.

You can pick your custom `truegit` subdomain or even your own domain. We manage the creation and renewal of SSL ceritificates for you!
